While the Nile is longer at 6,650 km (4,130 mi) compared to the Amazon's 6,400 km (4,000 mi), the Amazon's discharge is about 209,000 cubic meters per second, which is approximately 20% of all freshwater that flows into oceans.

      "text": "The Amazon River is significantly larger than the Mississippi River in several ways:\n\n1. Volume/Discharge: The Amazon's average discharge is about 209,000 cubic meters per second, which is more than 10 times that of the Mississippi (16,800 cubic meters per second).\n\n2. Length: The Amazon is approximately 6,400 km (4,000 mi) long, while the Mississippi is about 3,730 km (2,320 mi) long.\n\n3. Drainage Basin: The Amazon Basin covers about 7 million square kilometers, nearly 4 times larger than the Mississippi Basin at 1.85 million square kilometers.\n\nThe Amazon is not only larger than the Mississippi but is the largest river system in the world by volume and has the largest drainage basin.
